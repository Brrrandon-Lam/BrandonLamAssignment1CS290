        <h1> Questions</h1>
        <h2> Web Development Confidence </h2>
        <p> 2, I have virtually zero experience with HTML/CSS/JS, but I feel like I can pick it up with relative ease.</p>
        <h2> Learning Goal </h2>
        <p> I hope to learn basics of web development, because working in Javascript after some exposure from CS361 seems really cool.</p>
        <h2> Have I signed up for Piazza? Yes I have :)</h2>
        <h1> Fun Fact About Me </h1>
        <p> I enjoy reading manga and watching anime. Currently I am reading Act Age, a manga about the struggle of being a method actor like Heath Ledger. My favorite animes are Shirobako, Cowboy Bebop and Stein's Gate. </p>

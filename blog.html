            When working on the first assignment, I realized that my HTML coding knowledge is very barebones.
            But honestly it didn't feel too hard. I have had some previous experience. The biggest difficulty I ran into was
            figuring out how to create a .html file in Visual Studio and how to commit changes to github from a cloned repository.
            I am not experienced with using Visual Studio but I have been recommended to step away from MobaXTerm. The functionality of
            VS is really nice to have. From this assignment I learned to make some really basic things in HTML. I have had some experience with
            creating and formatting the structure of a page in HTML. I know little to nothing about CSS aside from class containers but it will
            be interesting to get a formal education. The extent of my web development knowledge comes from peer programming with graduate
            students in CS361, where I had to work on a website for a group project. I am hoping that it is going to be a great term and that I
            will be able to walk away with enough knowledge to continue web development. It definitely is a field of interest for me aside from my
            specialization (AI).

        <h1> Blog Post 2: CSS Assignment Reflection || 24 March 2020 </h1>
        <p>
            The most challenging thing about the assignment for me was the initial creation of the site. I honestly had no clue where to start by simply looking at the mocks.
            I spent a majority of the first day of the assignment just looking up CSS tutorials and going over the lecture notes. I also looked at some examples from tutorial websites
            such as the frog one posted to Piazza. Eventually, it started to click and I was stumbling my way through the first few mocks. As the assignment progressed I felt like I had
            a better understanding of what was going on and how to manipulate certain elements. From this assignment, I realized that understanding how to code in CSS is not too difficult
            once I actually learn the syntax. Then it just becomes a matter of refining and experience with the language. I googled a bunch of examples, such as tutorials on how to style links
            or how to manipulate the list. Overall, it was a great experience, but I was realizing that even though I could do the CSS without issue, my skill with HTML is still limited. I think that
            I need to spend more time practicing with HTML. I was able to pick up on the class structure rather easily after looking at the index.html file, but I probably would have no idea how to
            do it if I had to write the code from scratch. I imagine that knowledge would come with experience much like my work on styling the website.

        <h1> Blog Post 3: JavaScript Assignment Reflection || 9 May 2020 </h1>
        <p>
            The most challenging problems I had were figuring out how to even start. Similar to the last two assignments, my experience with JavaScript is very limited.
            Fortunately, JavaScript is much similar to C++ so I had less trouble with the syntax and more with getting the logic right for working with the HTML. I was struggling to
            order the twit itself properly, but I eventually figured it out by working through my twit creation function line by line. After asking on Piazza for help and doing research
            on how live searches work, I managed to figure out how to use the event listener and keyup to make a fully functional live search. After that, it was just a matter of finding
            the right way to access the correct parts of the twit, which I learned to do after reviewing the lecture notes. The most helpful resources were definitely the lectures and
            YouTube videos and Google. With all three things combined, I was able to figure out how to do the assignment in it's entirety, and figure out what needed to be done for the extra
            credit. My only regret is that I did not spend enough time on the assignment, so my live search function is bulky. It could be much less so if I ordered the user-added tweets to be 
            the same as the tweets that were implemented in the beginning, but to be frank, I just wanted to complete it as soon as possible. It has been hard to work on this assignment when I have
            multiple other classes hosting midterms. Hopefully I will be able to dedicate more time to the final project because I definitely want that to be as good as possible.

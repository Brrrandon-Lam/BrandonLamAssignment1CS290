        <p>When working on the first assignment, I realized that my HTML coding knowledge is very barebones. 
        But honestly it didn't feel too hard. I have had some previous experience. The biggest difficulty I ran into was
        figuring out how to create a .html file in Visual Studio and how to commit changes to github from a cloned repository.
        I am not experienced with using Visual Studio but I have been recommended to step away from MobaXTerm. The functionality of
        VS is really nice to have. From this assignment I learned to make some really basic things in HTML. I have had some experience with
        creating and formatting the structure of a page in HTML. I know little to nothing about CSS aside from class containers but it will
        be interesting to get a formal education. The extent of my web development knowledge comes from peer programming with graduate
        students in CS361, where I had to work on a website for a group project. I am hoping that it is going to be a great term and that I
        will be able to walk away with enough knowledge to continue web development. It definitely is a field of interest for me aside from my
        specialization (AI).

        <h1> Blog Post 2: CSS Assignment Reflection || 24 March 2020 </h1>
        <p> The most challenging thing about the assignment for me was the initial creation of the site. I honestly had no clue where to start by simply looking at the mocks.
        I spent a majority of the first day of the assignment just looking up CSS tutorials and going over the lecture notes. I also looked at some examples from tutorial websites
        such as the frog one posted to Piazza. Eventually, it started to click and I was stumbling my way through the first few mocks. As the assignment progressed I felt like I had
        a better understanding of what was going on and how to manipulate certain elements. From this assignment, I realized that understanding how to code in CSS is not too difficult
        once I actually learn the syntax. Then it just becomes a matter of refining and experience with the language. I googled a bunch of examples, such as tutorials on how to style links
        or how to manipulate the list. Overall, it was a great experience, but I was realizing that even though I could do the CSS without issue, my skill with HTML is still limited. I think that
        I need to spend more time practicing with HTML. I was able to pick up on the class structure rather easily after looking at the index.html file, but I probably would have no idea how to
        do it if I had to write the code from scratch. I imagine that knowledge would come with experience much like my work on styling the website.</p>

            When working on the first assignment, I realized that my HTML coding knowledge is very barebones.
            But honestly it didn't feel too hard. I have had some previous experience. The biggest difficulty I ran into was
            figuring out how to create a .html file in Visual Studio and how to commit changes to github from a cloned repository.
            I am not experienced with using Visual Studio but I have been recommended to step away from MobaXTerm. The functionality of
            VS is really nice to have. From this assignment I learned to make some really basic things in HTML. I have had some experience with
            creating and formatting the structure of a page in HTML. I know little to nothing about CSS aside from class containers but it will
            be interesting to get a formal education. The extent of my web development knowledge comes from peer programming with graduate
            students in CS361, where I had to work on a website for a group project. I am hoping that it is going to be a great term and that I
            will be able to walk away with enough knowledge to continue web development. It definitely is a field of interest for me aside from my
            specialization (AI).

        <h1> Blog Post 2: CSS Assignment Reflection || 24 March 2020 </h1>
        <p>
            The most challenging thing about the assignment for me was the initial creation of the site. I honestly had no clue where to start by simply looking at the mocks.
            I spent a majority of the first day of the assignment just looking up CSS tutorials and going over the lecture notes. I also looked at some examples from tutorial websites
            such as the frog one posted to Piazza. Eventually, it started to click and I was stumbling my way through the first few mocks. As the assignment progressed I felt like I had
            a better understanding of what was going on and how to manipulate certain elements. From this assignment, I realized that understanding how to code in CSS is not too difficult
            once I actually learn the syntax. Then it just becomes a matter of refining and experience with the language. I googled a bunch of examples, such as tutorials on how to style links
            or how to manipulate the list. Overall, it was a great experience, but I was realizing that even though I could do the CSS without issue, my skill with HTML is still limited. I think that
            I need to spend more time practicing with HTML. I was able to pick up on the class structure rather easily after looking at the index.html file, but I probably would have no idea how to
            do it if I had to write the code from scratch. I imagine that knowledge would come with experience much like my work on styling the website.

        <h1> Blog Post 3: JavaScript Assignment Reflection || 9 May 2020 </h1>
        <p>
            The most challenging problems I had were figuring out how to even start. Similar to the last two assignments, my experience with JavaScript is very limited.
            Fortunately, JavaScript is much similar to C++ so I had less trouble with the syntax and more with getting the logic right for working with the HTML. I was struggling to
            order the twit itself properly, but I eventually figured it out by working through my twit creation function line by line. After asking on Piazza for help and doing research
            on how live searches work, I managed to figure out how to use the event listener and keyup to make a fully functional live search. After that, it was just a matter of finding
            the right way to access the correct parts of the twit, which I learned to do after reviewing the lecture notes. The most helpful resources were definitely the lectures and
            YouTube videos and Google. With all three things combined, I was able to figure out how to do the assignment in it's entirety, and figure out what needed to be done for the extra
            credit. My only regret is that I did not spend enough time on the assignment, so my live search function is bulky. It could be much less so if I ordered the user-added tweets to be
            the same as the tweets that were implemented in the beginning, but to be frank, I just wanted to complete it as soon as possible. It has been hard to work on this assignment when I have
            multiple other classes hosting midterms. Hopefully I will be able to dedicate more time to the final project because I definitely want that to be as good as possible.

        <h1> Blog Post 4: Working with Node || 17 May 2020 </h1>
        <p>
            Honestly, for this assignment I was completely lost when it comes to working with Node. I had installed Node onto my system and looked up tutorials on npm. I also asked some of my
            friends because I could not understand it from looking at the lecture recordings, but I finally figured it out. That was probably my biggest issue with this assignment. I am still iffy on
            working with Node but hopefully in the future it will be fine. Other than that, the assignment went pretty well. Same issues as the previous assignments, where my lacking experience in Javascript
            caused some difficulty, but looking at the example code from lecture and reading over the slides helped me greatly. The one issue that arose that I had was that the content type of the index.js had to
            specifically be 'application/javascript' to get full credit for the assignment. I didn't really understand why that was the case, and I had to ask my friend. What I learned from him was that if I were
            to simply refer to it as js, it may interfere with and cause issues with something called a valid MIME type. I was hoping that I could get more information regarding what this is. Other than that,
            I felt that this assignment was really easy. It was cool to set something up on localhost and I can't wait to continue to work with Javascript to make a cool site for the final project.
            I had done work for CS361 in Javascript but I had no idea what was going on. Now, I can look back at the repository for that code and I have a decent grasp over what we had to do for that project.
            Overall, it was a great learning experience and I am glad to say that I can probably apply this to many other things if I decide to take the web development path.'

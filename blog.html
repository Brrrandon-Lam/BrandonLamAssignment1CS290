        <h1>Initial Thoughts on this Class</h1>
        <p>When working on the first assignment, I realized that my HTML coding knowledge is very barebones. 
        But honestly it didn't feel too hard. I have had some previous experience. The biggest difficulty I ran into was
        figuring out how to create a .html file in Visual Studio and how to commit changes to github from a cloned repository.
        I am not experienced with using Visual Studio but I have been recommended to step away from MobaXTerm. The functionality of
        VS is really nice to have. From this assignment I learned to make some really basic things in HTML. I have had some experience with
        creating and formatting the structure of a page in HTML. I know little to nothing about CSS aside from class containers but it will
        be interesting to get a formal education. The extent of my web development knowledge comes from peer programming with graduate
        students in CS361, where I had to work on a website for a group project. I am hoping that it is going to be a great term and that I
        will be able to walk away with enough knowledge to continue web development. It definitely is a field of interest for me aside from my
        specialization (AI).
